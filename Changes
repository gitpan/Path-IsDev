Release history for Path-IsDev

0.5.0 2013-10-05T15:00:12Z
 [00 Major Changes - Result Object]
 - Internals now re-written slightly to pass around a result object that
   communicates state.
 - Everywhere $path was previously used, $result_object->path is now used
   instead.
 - $result_object->path guaranteed to exist and be a ref of some kind.
 - $result_object->path automatically upgraded to Path::Tiny if provided as
   a string
 - ->matches() and ->excludes() can now record results of heuristics by
   invoking $result_object->add_reason()
 - Path::IsDev::Object->_matches($path) now exists and returns a Result
   Object for $path
 - Dumping result object will give you as much info as turning debugging on
   would

0.4.0 2013-09-27T17:48:00Z
 [00 Major Changes - Negative Heuristics]
 - Now has a system to indicate negative heuristics, to mark  given
   directories as "not dev", which cause other postive heuristics to be
   ignored.
 - One basic negative heuristic added, 'IsDev::IgnoreFile'
 - Basic Negative heuristic comes standard with the basic set.

 [!Major]
