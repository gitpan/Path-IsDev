1.000000 2013-10-18T09:55:20Z
 [00 Supermajor Changes - Breaking Everything]
 - This release comes with many significant changes that are likely to break any closely built dependencies.
 - External export interface contains no visible changes, but underyling plumbing is under heavy construction.

 [01 Role Refactory]
 - Any existing code that relied on previous roles or base classes will be BROKEN by this release.
 - Roles again reimplemented and split to be more horizonal instead of vertically integrated.
 - This means all Heuristics need to provide a ->matches() or ->excludes() method now, and manually call their
   composite roles, and manually set $result_object->result(1) where relevant.

 [02 Base class removal]
 - Base classes that we're deprecated in 0.6.0 are gone now.

 [03 Version Schema Change]
 - Version scheme is now Y.nnnnnn . If this is a problem for you, this means you're a downstream who doesn't normalise
   versions yet. Please learn to normalise, perl upstream break your assumptions.
 - Versions will retain semantic difference, just there more "perl internals" friendly.

 [04 New Heuristic Match Types]
 - Now a Matcher that matches on full paths

 [05 New Negative Heuristics]
 - ::HomeDir - Excludes all the paths returned by File::HomeDir
 - ::PerlINC - Excludes all the paths in Config.pm

 [06 Updated Heuristic Sets]
 - ::Basic now includes ::HomeDir and ::PerlINC exclusions

 [07 Internals]
 - Requirement for matches to debug themselves greatly reduced.
 - Matches now only need to report context feedback via the result object
 - The result object intelligently executes relevant debugging intel

 [Dependencies]
 - Now depends on File::HomeDir
 - Perl 5.6 is now minimum ( was 5.10 )
 - Test::More increased.

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.6.0, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - develop: ↑2
 - runtime: +1 ↓1
 - test: ↑1

0.6.0 2013-10-05T17:56:06Z
 [00 Major Changes - Role Apocalypse]
 - All internals that could be rewritten to invoke roles instead of inheritance, have been done so.
 - Base classes for existing things still exist, and should still work, however, they're on borrowed time.

 [Dependencies]
 - Now requires Role::Tiny
 - No longer requires parent

 [Dependencies::Stats]
 - Dependencies changed since 0.5.0, see misc/*.deps* for details
 - runtime: +2 -1

0.5.0 2013-10-05T15:00:12Z
 [00 Major Changes - Result Object]
 - Internals now re-written slightly to pass around a result object that communicates state.
 - Everywhere $path was previously used, $result_object->path is now used instead.
 - $result_object->path guaranteed to exist and be a ref of some kind.
 - $result_object->path automatically upgraded to Path::Tiny if provided as a string
 - ->matches() and ->excludes() can now record results of heuristics by invoking $result_object->add_reason()
 - Path::IsDev::Object->_matches($path) now exists and returns a Result Object for $path
 - Dumping result object will give you as much info as turning debugging on would

0.4.0 2013-09-27T17:48:00Z
 [00 Major Changes - Negative Heuristics]
 - Now has a system to indicate negative heuristics, to mark  given directories as "not dev", which cause other postive
   heuristics to be ignored.
 - One basic negative heuristic added, 'IsDev::IgnoreFile'
 - Basic Negative heuristic comes standard with the basic set.

 [!Major]
 - Now uses Class::Tiny instead of Moo internally.
 - New Heuristic VCS::Git and is part of the Basic set. ( Because I found a few projects where I didn't have any
   toolkit specific files, but I wanted to find the root anyway, and I assumed my own code would just work, but it
   wouldn't ... )
